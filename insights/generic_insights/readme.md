Below are the mongodb aggregation pipelines that are executed on the actual data generated over a period of time, 

daily_agg_passenger_rating
daily_agg_vehicle_stats
daily_agg_vehicle_type_preference
hourly_agg_rides_stats

based on the aggregated data, the data is then projected using matplotlib for providing meaningful insights for service improvements.
Some of the class dependiencies are common for all the insights, hence placed on the root dir.
